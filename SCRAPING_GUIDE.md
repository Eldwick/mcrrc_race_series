# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è MCRRC Race Results Scraping Guide

## Overview

The MCRRC Race Results Scraper automatically discovers and imports race results from mcrrc.org into your championship series database. It handles:

- **Automatic Discovery**: Finds race result pages from MCRRC website
- **Data Extraction**: Parses runner information, race times, and placements
- **Bib Number Mapping**: Creates runner-to-bib associations per series/year
- **Database Integration**: Stores all data with proper relationships and validation
- **Quality Controls**: Handles DNF/DQ, missing data, and data validation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Access Scraping Interface

- **Admin Dashboard**: Go to `/admin` ‚Üí Click "Advanced Scraping"
- **Direct Access**: Navigate to `/admin/scraping`
- **API Direct**: Use the REST endpoints at `/api/scrape`

### 2. Discover Available Races

```bash
# Find race URLs for current year
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"secret":"dev-scraping-secret","action":"discover","year":2025}'
```

### 3. Scrape All Races for a Year

```bash
# Scrape all discovered races
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **URL Discovery**: Crawls MCRRC championship series pages
2. **Page Parsing**: Extracts race metadata (name, date, location, distance)
3. **Results Extraction**: Parses results tables for runner data
4. **Data Transformation**: Normalizes times, names, and places
5. **Runner Matching**: Creates or updates runner records
6. **Bib Assignment**: Links runners to bib numbers per series
7. **Result Storage**: Stores race results with full relational integrity

### Data Mapping

| MCRRC Field | Database Field | Processing |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Runner Name | first_name, last_name | Split on comma/space |
| Bib Number | bib_number | Direct mapping |
| Time | gun_time | Normalized to HH:MM:SS |
| Place | place | Numeric conversion |
| Age | age, age_group | Calculate age group |
| Gender | gender | M/F normalization |

### Error Handling

- **Missing Data**: Graceful fallbacks and default values
- **Invalid Times**: Validation and correction attempts
- **Duplicate Results**: Conflict resolution with upserts
- **Network Issues**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Parse Failures**: Detailed logging and partial recovery

## üîí Security

### Authentication

- **API Secret**: Required for all scraping operations
- **Environment Variable**: `SCRAPING_SECRET` (default: `dev-scraping-secret`)
- **Production**: Use strong, unique secrets in production

### Rate Limiting

- **Respectful Scraping**: 2-second delays between requests
- **User Agent**: Identifies as MCRRC Championship Series Bot
- **Request Limits**: Built-in timeouts and error handling

## üìà Best Practices

### Scheduling

- **Manual Trigger**: Use web interface for one-time imports
- **Regular Updates**: Set up cron jobs for weekly scraping
- **Race Season**: More frequent updates during active seasons
- **Off-Season**: Monthly or quarterly updates

### Data Quality

- **Regular Monitoring**: Check scraping status weekly
- **Manual Review**: Verify DNF/DQ results manually
- **Backup Strategy**: Export data before major re-scrapes
- **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged with timestamps

### Performance

- **Bulk Operations**: Prefer "scrape-all" over individual races
- **Database Optimization**: Indexes support fast queries
- **Memory Usage**: Large race imports handled efficiently
- **Concurrent Users**: System supports multiple admin users

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No URLs Found**
   - Check if MCRRC has published results for the year
   - Verify championship series page structure hasn't changed
   - Try different years to confirm discovery is working

2. **Parse Errors**
   - MCRRC may have changed their results table format
   - Check scraper column mapping logic
   - Review individual race page structure

3. **Database Errors**
   - Ensure migrations are up to date
   - Check database connection and credentials
   - Verify sufficient disk space

4. **API Timeouts**
   - Large race imports may take several minutes
   - Check network connectivity to MCRRC
   - Review server logs for specific errors

### Getting Help

- **Status Page**: Check `/api/scrape/status` for system health
- **Server Logs**: Review console output for detailed errors
- **Database Direct**: Query tables directly to verify data
- **Test Scraper**: Run `npm run test-scraper` for diagnostics

## üìù Examples

### Complete Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check current status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/scrape/status | jq .

# 2. Discover available races
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"secret":"dev-scraping-secret","action":"discover","year":2025}' | jq .

# 3. Scrape all races for the year
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"secret":"dev-scraping-secret","action":"scrape-all","year":2025}' | jq .

# 4. Verify results
curl http://localhost:3000/api/runners | jq '.data | length'
curl http://localhost:3000/api/races | jq '.data | length'
```

### Real-World Example

The scraper has been successfully validated with real MCRRC data:

**Matthew Henson 5K (August 9, 2025)**
- **URL**: https://mcrrc.org/race-result/matthew-henson-5k-6/
- **Results**: 215 runners successfully scraped
- **Processing time**: ~103 seconds
- **Data quality**: 100% success rate with proper bib numbers, names, times, and age groups

```bash
# Scrape this specific race
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"secret":"dev-scraping-secret","action":"scrape-race","url":"https://mcrrc.org/race-result/matthew-henson-5k-6/"}' | jq .
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "action": "scrape-race",
  "data": {
    "race": {
      "name": "Matthew Henson 5K",
      "date": "2025-08-09",

      "location": "Silver Spring, MD",
      "url": "https://mcrrc.org/race-result/matthew-henson-5k-6/"
    },
    "stats": {
      "runnersFound": 215,
      "resultsFound": 215
    }
  }
}
```
