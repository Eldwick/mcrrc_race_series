# Post-Debug Race Verification Guide

After debugging and fixing scraping issues for specific race URLs, use these tools to verify fixes and update data.

## Quick Fix Verification

```bash
npm run verify-race-fix "https://mcrrc.org/race-result/race-name/"
```

## What It Does

1. **Tests the current scraping logic** on the problematic URL
2. **Shows sample results** to verify names aren't truncated
3. **Detects common truncation patterns** (like "las", "an", "ey" prefixes)
4. **Provides clear status** - LOOKS GOOD or NEEDS REVIEW
5. **Suggests next steps** for database updates

## Example Workflow

1. **Debug a problematic race:**
   ```bash
   npm run debug:race-scraper "https://mcrrc.org/race-result/capital-for-a-day-5k-3/"
   ```

2. **Fix the scraping issues** (like name truncation)

3. **Verify the fix worked:**
   ```bash
   npm run verify-race-fix "https://mcrrc.org/race-result/capital-for-a-day-5k-3/"
   ```

4. **Save the corrected data to database:**
   ```bash
   npm run scrape-single-race "https://mcrrc.org/race-result/country-road-run-5/"
   ```
